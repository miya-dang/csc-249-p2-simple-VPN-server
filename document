Simple VPN Apllication 

1. Overview of Application:
This application consists of a client and a VPN server that forwards messages to a echo server. The VPN acts as an intermediary between the client and the remote server, forwarding client messages to the server and sending server responses back to the client.

2. Client -> VPN Server Message
-  Format: "SERVER_IP SERVER_PORT message"
-  Where:
    SERVER_IP: The destination server's IP address.
    SERVER_PORT: The destination server's port number.
    message: The actual message that the client wants to send to the server.
-  Example: "127.0.0.1 8080 Hello, server!"

3. VPN Server -> Client Message
-  Format: The exact response as received by the destination server.
-  Example: If the destination server sends the message "Hello world!", the message is returned exactly to the client: "Hello world!".
